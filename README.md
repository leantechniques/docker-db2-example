# Running IBM DB2 on Docker (An Example)

## Requirements
 - Docker
 - Docker Compose
 
## Usage
This solution is based on the [`ibmcom/db2express-c`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/db2express-c/) container.

To start the container, run `do/local-docker.sh` from the root of the project.

Once started you can connect using the port `50000` to you local machine.
